```javascript
<div class="bg-gray-300 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Unexpected Behavior</h2>
  <p>I'm experiencing an issue where my Tailwind classes aren't being applied correctly. Specifically, the `bg-gray-300` class doesn't seem to be changing the background color, and the `rounded-lg` class isn't adding rounded corners.</p>
  <p>I've checked my Tailwind configuration, and everything seems to be set up correctly. I'm including the necessary stylesheet and have purged the CSS. I can't figure out what's causing this issue.</p>
</div>
